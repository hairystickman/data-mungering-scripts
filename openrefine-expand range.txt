Python snippet for  automatically explode a range of numbers defined by upper and lower bounds.

# Use in cell transform

# note that for some reason the range-function will only provide the numbers from first to penultimate when given 2 numbers.
# eg. given 1-5
# split the line on '-' to give 1 and 5 then do
# range(1,5) will give 1,2,3,4. 
# 5 needs to be added to the end. 


return str(range(int(value.split("-")[0]),int(value.split("-")[1]))).replace(", ",";").replace("[","").replace("]","") + ";" + str(int(value.split("-")[1]))
